          <p>It was back in August 2019 when I was in Thalassery for my cousin Irfan's wedding. Most of my cousins are settled in the Middle East, and we all gather on occasions like this. I was thrilled to see all those familiar faces after such a long time. It was a joyful week. Irfan wasn't just a cousin to me; he was also my best buddy. We grew up together and were classmates until the 10th standard. After 10th grade, our academic paths diverged, but our bond remained strong. I had a wonderful time attending his wedding and all the other related functions.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Kerala Floods</h2>
          <p>It was a time when Kerala was suffering from a flood, but our place, Thalassery, was not affected by the grace of God. Occasionally, there would be heavy rainfall, but we managed to successfully conduct the wedding despite the terrible weather. A few days after the wedding, I asked him about going somewhere. We didn't want to venture too far due to the unsafe conditions caused by the heavy rainfall. After considering various places, we decided to visit 'Palakkayam Thattu,' a small hill station located at an altitude of 3500 ft above sea level. It was approximately 70 km away from Thalassery. We invited his brother, Ihsan, and another cousin, Jeyyuka, to join us on the trip, and we planned to leave the next morning.</p>

          <p>It is said that the sunrise is beautiful when viewed from the peak. So we planned to leave at 5 AM. I went to bed, but I couldn't sleep. I have a problemâ€”I get too excited the night before any trip, and I can barely sleep. I was also worried that we wouldn't be able to go due to the heavy rain throughout the night. And Irfan, he's not a morning person; sometimes it's really difficult to wake him up early in the morning. That night, he was staying at his wife's place, so there was no way for me to wake him up. If he misses the alarm, we will miss the trip.</p>

          <!-- <blockquote class="blockquote"></blockquote> -->

          <p>I managed to get some sleep and woke up to my alarm. As I had feared, it was still raining. It was a bad sign. I was sleeping in Ihsan's room, and I tried to wake him up, but he was being lazy and used the rain as an excuse. He believed that there was no way we could make it happen in this rain. I was disappointed by the rain, but I still wanted to go.</p> 

          <!-- <a href="#">

          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted"></span> -->
          <h2 class="section-heading">The Glass is half full</h2>
          <p>I called Irfan and Jeyyuka to check if they were awake. Fortunately, both of them were already awake, and the three of us decided to take a chance despite the heavy rainfall. I was really happy to see their enthusiasm. Irfan called me and instructed me to wait outside as he had already left from his place. He picked up Jeyyuka on the way and then picked me up. It was still raining, but we stayed positive. I got into the car and asked our favorite lady, Google, to provide directions to 'Palakkayam Thattu'. It was 5:20 AM, and it would take approximately another 2 hours to reach 'Palakkayam Thattu'. Therefore, we weren't sure if we could make it before the sunrise. However, our main concern was the ongoing rainfall.</p>
          <p>We embarked on our journey, and I felt delighted to travel with my cousins after such a long time. Despite the rain, it was enjoyable to be in the car. The sound of the rain and the rhythmic wiper beats lifted my spirits. I was craving a cup of black tea, as the Malayalis say, "Ithiri Mohabbat itta oru Sulaimani." However, our priority was to reach our destination as early as possible. After a while, my stomach started to growl loudly. Yes, we were starving, so we decided to stop at the next tea stall we came across. As we made our way towards 'Palakkayam Thattu,' I kept my eyes peeled for a tea stall on both sides of the road. After traveling a few more kilometers, we finally spotted a tea stall. The rain wasn't pouring heavily, but rather drizzling. We entered the tea stall and placed an order for omelets and tea. A cool breeze gently caressed my face and whispered into my ears. The weather was splendid. It was the perfect moment to savor a freshly cooked omelet.</p> 
          <p>We all enjoyed omelets and tea, savoring the delightful weather. By the time we finished our breakfast, the sunrise was nearly upon us. We then returned to the car and resumed our journey. It started raining again, and the inconsistency of the weather began to worry us. If it continued to rain while we were hiking, we would end up getting drenched. Thus, we started searching for a shop to purchase umbrellas. Eventually, we found a shop and bought three umbrellas. At that moment, it was drizzling. We carried on with our journey, and as we approached the destination, the road became increasingly treacherous. Eventually, we encountered a steep uphill road. After conquering that ascent, we spotted a signboard indicating "Palakkayam Thattu." Adjacent to it was a parking area on the right side. Believing that we had finally arrived at our destination, we parked the car.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">An Off-road Ride</h2>
          <p>To our surprise, we discovered that we hadn't reached our destination yet, and it was still 30 minutes away. A local resident informed us that driving our car through the road carved on the hill would be extremely challenging. As a solution, they offered private jeep services. Since we had come this far, we decided to inquire about the cost of the jeep service. The local person informed us that it would cost 2000 INR for a round trip, including waiting time. Additionally, besides 'Palakkayam Thattu', the jeep would also take us to two other places, namely Ayyanmada Cave and Ezharakund Waterfalls. Although I hadn't heard of these places before, I was filled with excitement. Fortunately, we had packed swim shorts, just in case, and they turned out to be quite useful!</p>
          <p>We took our belongings from the car and transferred them to the Jeep. Then, we embarked on the off-road ride. The driver was a friendly individual who began sharing valuable information about the area. He even pointed out the portions that had been washed away during the flood. Subsequently, he initiated a discussion about the Ayyanmada Cave, which would be our first destination. This naturally formed cave spans over 200 meters and holds historical significance as a place where a Buddhist monk meditated centuries ago. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to witness this enchanting cave that I had never heard of before.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">A Mysterious Cave</h2>
          <a href="">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/01.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">Rubber plantations near the Ayyanmada Cave</span>
          <p>We arrived at the location and disembarked from the Jeep. Rubber plantations stretched as far as the eye could see. I anticipated a lengthy hike to reach the cave, but to my surprise, it was located right by the road. We descended a few steps and proceeded towards the cave. A picturesque stream paved the way, leading us to our destination. Due to the continuous rainfall, the stream was flowing vigorously towards the cave. The stones beneath our feet were slippery, so we proceeded with caution. As I walked towards the cave, I started recording a video, capturing the captivating sight of the stream merging into the cave. We were all filled with joy to have discovered this unexpected gem, which wasn't initially part of our plan. That's one of the things I love about traveling - the opportunity to stumble upon new places and gain new knowledge. The experiences I gather from my journeys are truly invaluable.</p>
          <p>It was pitch dark inside the cave, and we were ill-prepared for a cave expedition. Using our phone flashlights, we attempted to illuminate the surroundings, but it remained dim. The phone flashlights proved insufficient. Despite the limited visibility, we could discern that the cave stretched out quite far. I wished we could have ventured all the way to the end, but it was the monsoon season, rendering it unsafe to proceed. Thus, we stood within the cave, surrounded by darkness, and directed our gaze towards the outside. The sight of the water stream maneuvering through various obstacles was truly mesmerizing. The water flowed pure and crystal clear, untainted by pollution.</p>
          <p>After spending approximately 20 minutes in the Cave, we resumed our journey towards 'Palakkayam Thattu'. The route leading to 'Palakkayam Thattu' was adorned with the beauty of rubber and cocoa tree plantations. Irfan stood up at the back of the jeep to capture a 360-degree view of the stunning natural surroundings. With the wind gently caressing his face, he breathed in the fresh air. I could tell that he was overjoyed and revitalized. Despite the potential safety risks, he remained standing, capturing videos of the scenery along the way.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">The Two Eyes (frames) of Kannur</h2>
          <p>We were almost at our destination, and I could spot the signboard up ahead. The road resembled a mountain pass, offering a breathtaking view of the valley adorned with rubber and cocoa plantations. The driver pulled over at the entrance, where a ticket counter was situated. After purchasing our tickets, we began our hike up the hill. To reach the peak, we had to ascend several hundred meters. A few meters ahead, we could catch sight of the first frame. Yes, a picture frame, a colossal one, which served as the main attraction of this location. No visitor departs from 'Palakkayam Thattu' without capturing a photo at these frames. It had become a customary ritual.</p>
          
          <p>The frame was not placed randomly; it had a purpose. The scenery itself was awe-inspiring. Observing the frame from a distance, it appeared to be a picture of a magnificent landscape. However, when viewed through the frame, the boundary of Kannur and beyond came into sight. On one side, there stood the Pythal hill, while on the other side, one could admire the verdant green forests of Coorg.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">The frame at the peak.</span>
          <p>As we made our way to 'Palakkayam Thattu', the surroundings were enveloped in dense fog. However, once we commenced our hike, the fog gradually dissipated, unveiling the captivating scenery. Nature showcased its beauty to us, and the fog lifted like a curtain on a stage. We felt fortunate that the weather was not accompanied by rain, allowing the fog to disperse.</p>
          <p>Now, onto the main eventâ€”the photo-taking at the frame. We captured several photos while standing within the frame. Afterward, we proceeded with our hike towards the peak. Upon reaching the summit, we encountered yet another frame, which I presumed to be the primary one. I must admit, the view from the peak was stunning. We took several photos in various poses to commemorate the experience.</p>
          <a href="">

          <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">The frame at the base.</span> -->
          <p>Although we missed the sunrise, I believe we would have been disappointed if we had arrived earlier. Most likely, it would have been foggy or raining. We were content that everything had gone smoothly throughout the trip, despite it being the monsoon season with heavy rainfall. We encountered no troubles along the way, which was quite fortunate.</p>

          <p>I noticed the presence of ziplines, zorbing, and various other adventure activities in the vicinity. While I enjoy ziplines, the one there didn't seem particularly enticing. It appeared to be insufficient in both length and height. We could discern that the zipline wasn't properly calibrated. As we observed the activities, the next person on the zipline failed to reach the finish line. It came to a halt before reaching its intended destination. Since it wasn't very high, another person had to push them towards the finish line. We burst into laughter and felt fortunate that we hadn't wasted our money on that particular attraction.</p>

          <p>Adventure activities failed to captivate my attention, but the beauty of nature certainly did. It was incredibly stunning, and I could have spent the entire day simply admiring the natural surroundings. We noticed that fog was rolling in, prompting us to begin our hike back towards the Jeep. Just as we neared the vehicle, it started to rain, and we hurriedly sprinted to seek shelter inside the Jeep. Once again, luck was on our side.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">A Paradise with seven natural pools</h2>
          <p>Our next destination was Ezharakund Waterfalls, so the rain was not a concern. We proceeded with our journey towards the waterfalls. Glancing at the Google Map, I realized that we were close to the border of Karnataka. The Coorg district in Karnataka was a mere 10 minutes away from the waterfalls. It turned out to be another enjoyable ride as we traversed through the picturesque trails.</p>

          <p>After traveling for approximately 30 minutes, we arrived at our designated spotâ€”or so I believed. The jeep could only take us to a certain point, from where we had to proceed on foot. Nevertheless, it wasn't a great distance to cover. We left our water bottles and other belongings inside the jeep, taking only the essentials: a t-shirt and swim shorts. As we walked towards the waterfalls, we noticed a small house along the way. A woman, in her early 50s, was hanging laundry out to dry. Our driver called out her name and asked whether the Waterfalls was open. She instructed us to wait outside the gate as the guide would be arriving shortly. The waterfalls were managed and maintained by the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC). We needed to purchase tickets, and a guide would accompany us throughout our visit to the waterfalls.</p>
          <a href="">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/05.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">Caption goes here.</span> -->
          <p>We didn't have to wait for long. As we stood outside the gate, we spotted him approaching. He arrived and unlocked the gate for us. We entered, and he introduced himself as our guide. It turned out that the woman we had seen earlier was his mother, and the house we had passed belonged to him. He had acquired the job due to being a resident of the area. He opened his cabin, stored his belongings, and officially began his role as our guide. After purchasing the tickets, he assigned himself to be our guide. I had expected there to be other guides working alongside him, with his responsibility primarily at the ticket counter. However, I couldn't find anyone else around. Regardless, we were the only tourists present at that time. When I inquired about this, he informed me that other guides were stationed at the exit gate. If additional tourists were to arrive, they would come up to this area and accompany them.</p>
          <p>When I laid eyes on the waterfalls, I was filled with immense joy. I had never expected such a spectacular waterfall. Ezharakund Waterfalls is composed of seven levels of rocky natural pools, each varying in size and depth. This is what gives it its name, Ezharakund, which translates to "seven and a half pit" in the Malayalam language. Since it was the monsoon season with heavy rainfall, the waterfalls were at their prime. An abundance of water cascaded down, and we could feel its force. It was evident that going anywhere near the water would pose a serious risk of injury or, worst-case scenario, even death. Although the vertical drop wasn't exceptionally high, the power of the water was evident. I noticed a rope tied across the waterfall, which sparked excitement within me. However, we all knew the answer: it was a resounding "No." I inquired with the guide, who explained that he couldn't allow anyone to cross the waterfall due to its extreme danger. Well, it made perfect sense. The hazardous conditions were evident by observing the forceful water flow. Additionally, there was another drop a few meters away. Therefore, if anyone were to slip, they would be swept away by the rapids and plummet over the vertical drop. Naturally, that plan swiftly left my mind.</p>
          <p>So the question is, can we utilize the swim shorts we carried all the way? Is there a designated area where we can enter the water? When I inquired with the guide, he informed me that there is indeed a swimming spot located further downhill. After spending some time admiring the waterfalls and capturing a few photos, we began our descent along the waterfalls. To our even greater surprise, the stretch extended for over a kilometer. We had to hike more than a kilometer to reach the designated swimming area. My excitement grew exponentially. I have a great fondness for swimming, especially in open and fresh waters. It is the ultimate experience I could wish for. Filled with anticipation, we continued our walk.</p>

          <p>It wasn't just the waterfalls; the surrounding areas were also incredibly beautiful. Our initial plan was to only visit 'Palakkayam Thattu,' which was meant to be our main destination. However, now it has shifted to this breathtaking waterfall. It felt like we were in the perfect place at the perfect time.</p>
          <a href="">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/04.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">Caption goes here.</span> -->
          <p>I searched for information about this place and discovered that it wasn't widely known. As I delved deeper into my research, I noticed that in all the photos available on the internet, the waterfall appeared dry. However, it seemed that the heavy rainfall during this monsoon season had transformed it into a paradise. We were simply fortunate to have witnessed it in such a magnificent state.</p>
          <p>Not to mention, the trail itself was also remarkably beautiful. Along the way, we encountered steps constructed on a slope, with water gracefully flowing through them. It was truly a picture-perfect sight.</p>
          <a href="">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/07.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">Caption goes here.</span> -->
          <p>During our journey, we came across a hanging bridge that aided us in crossing a rapid. It was encompassed by bamboo trees, creating a surreal atmosphere reminiscent of a fantasy world. This presented yet another photo opportunity, one we couldn't pass up. We captured a few pictures while standing on the hanging bridge before resuming our walk.</p>
          <a href="">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/08.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <span class="caption text-muted">The Hanging bridge over the Rapids.</span>
          <h2 class="section-heading">The Rapids</h2>
          <p>While hiking, we made several stops along the trail, captivated by its beauty. Eventually, we arrived at our designated swimming spot. Our guide had informed us that he would provide life jackets for our safety. Despite being a confident swimmer, I felt the urge to test the waters and asked the guide if I could swim without wearing the life jacket. Surprisingly, he agreed. However, upon reaching the spot and observing the rapid, I began to doubt my decision. To assess the current, I cautiously dipped my lower leg into the water while sitting on a nearby rock. Instantly, I felt the force pulling my leg in the direction of the water flow. It became clear to me just how powerful the current was. If I had jumped into the water without a life jacket, I could have been swept away and either fallen from a vertical drop or collided with a rock. I believe even our guide underestimated the strength of the current that day, likely intensified by the heavy rainfall we experienced the previous day.</p>
          <a href="">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/06.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
          <!-- <span class="caption text-muted">Caption goes here.</span> -->
          <p>I made the decision to wear a life jacket before entering the water. Irfan and I changed into our swimming attire and donned the life jackets over our t-shirts. As an added safety measure, a rope had been tied across the rapid. Slowly, we entered the water while holding onto the rope. Once immersed, we immediately felt the strength of the current. It was evident that even with the life jackets, we couldn't consider ourselves completely safe. We found ourselves being carried along with the flow of the water, but the rope prevented us from being swept further downstream. After acclimating to the water, we decided to attempt swimming against the current. I must admit, it was quite challenging. I had to exert five times the effort for each stroke to make any progress. Despite swimming at full throttle, I could only manage to move a few meters. I continued swimming, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't move any farther. The moment I ceased swimming, I found myself being carried back in the opposite direction, against the force of the water. Thankfully, I swiftly reached out and grasped onto the rope for stability.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">The Vertical Drop</h2>
          <p>After admitting defeat, I noticed another rope fastened along the rapid on the opposite side. Fueled by determination, I swam towards that rope with all my energy. Gripping onto it tightly, I began inching closer to the vertical drop. As I approached the drop, the current intensified, growing stronger with each passing moment. Progressing cautiously, I navigated through various obstacles and steps within the streambed. Finally, when I neared the vertical drop, I could distinctly feel the tremendous force of the water cascading downward.</p>
                    
          <p>As someone who enjoys adventures, this experience brought me immense joy. I relished every moment of it. Standing near the vertical drop, with 80% of my body submerged in the water, I could sense the exhilarating rush of adrenaline. I yearned to experience the sensation of being carried along by the powerful current of the rapid. With determination, I propelled myself into the water, and that was the turning point. The water embraced me like a child, and I found myself effortlessly flowing with the rapid.</p>
          <p>For a brief moment, I feared losing control and potentially colliding with a rock. Fortunately, I skillfully maneuvered through the obstacles and successfully grasped the rope when I reached its vicinity. This experience was truly remarkable, as nowadays authorities typically prohibit people from venturing into dangerous waterfalls. We were incredibly fortunate to have been there at the perfect moment.</p>

          <p>After spending approximately an hour at the waterfalls, we made the decision to depart. Both of us headed towards the public washroom to change our clothes. In the meantime, Jeyyuka kindly ordered tea for us. The feeling of sipping hot tea after the exhilarating activity was incredibly refreshing. We savored the tea while enjoying the breathtaking view of the waterfalls.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Monday Blues</h2>
          <p>After concluding our tea break, we began our walk towards the exit gate, where our driver patiently awaited our return. We boarded the Jeep and returned to their campsite. From there, we transferred to our car and embarked on our journey back to Thalassery. As Irfan took the wheel, I comfortably settled into the passenger seat. After some time, our appetites grew, and we collectively decided to find a place to eat. We stumbled upon a small restaurant and indulged in a delectable feast of Malabari fritter dishes. Satisfied and content, we resumed our drive back to Thalassery, cherishing all the wonderful memories we had created.</p>
